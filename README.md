## Introduction

This project is aimed at demonstrating the core principles of OOP in Java, as well as providing practical examples of GUI and threading. The examples and code in this repository are intended to be educational and can be used as a reference for learning and understanding Java programming.

## Features

- **OOP Concepts**: Implementation of classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
- **GUI**: Examples of building graphical user interfaces using Java Swing.
- **Threads**: Demonstrations of multithreading and concurrent programming in Java.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/samarthsinh2660/java.git
